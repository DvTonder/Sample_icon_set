3) For best results, image dimensions should be as follows:
   - MHDPI = 64x64
   - HDPI = 90x90
   - XHDPI = 128x128
   - XXHDPI = 192x192
   - XXXHDPI = 256x256
4) Moon phase images are named moon_xx.png. You need at least 8 drawables at 0, 15, 25, 35, 50, 65, 75, 85 and 100. Max is 100 drawables
